# World-population-analysis

This project uses data from the CIA World Factbook, which is a collection of statistics for all countries on Earth. Demographic data for the project comes from 2023

The original dataset from the CIA World Factbook consisted of 261 rows, but I chose not to include data for dependent territories such as: Virgin Islands, Niue, Jan Mayen, etc.  The final data set consists of 12 columns and 195 rows.
